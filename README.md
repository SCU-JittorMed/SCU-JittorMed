## About SCU-JittorMed

This GitHub organization is established by the **Center for Intelligent Medicine at Sichuan University**, aiming to provide cutting-edge **Jittor-based artificial intelligence methods for medical analysis**.

The repositories are dedicated to adapting and extending the **Jittor framework** ([Jittor Official Site](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jittor/)) for intelligent medical applications, and are jointly maintained by [**Prof. Zhang Yi**](http://www.machineilab.org/users/zhangyi/index.html) and [**Junjie Hu**](https://junjiehuscu.github.io/).

We welcome collaborators and contributors who are interested in building novel medical analysis tools using Jittor. If you are interested in contributing or developing new projects, feel free to contact us at **hujunjie@scu.edu.cn**.
